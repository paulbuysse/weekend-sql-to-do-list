# Paul's To-Do List

## Description
This is a to-do list app where you can add tasks you wish to complete.
When you complete a task, click the check button next to the task you
completed. If you wish to remove a task, click the trash can button to 
the right of the task you want to remove.

All tasks are stored in a database along with an ID number and
completion status. When a task is marked as completed, the
database will update to show this change. When a task is removed,
it will be removed from the database.

Thanks to Prime Academy for making this app possible!
